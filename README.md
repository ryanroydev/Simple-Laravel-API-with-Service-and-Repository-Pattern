# Simple-Laravel-API-with-Service-and-Repository-Pattern
This is a simple, clean, and scalable **RESTful API** built with **Laravel** designed for managing an inventory system. The project demonstrates the use of the **Service Design Pattern** and **Repository Pattern** to organize business logic and data access layers efficiently. The code also includes unit tests to ensure the API works as expected.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve product information.
- **Service & Repository Patterns**: Implements a well-structured codebase with a separation of concerns.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes test cases for common API operations (CRUD).
- **Optimized for scalability**: Easy to extend for larger, more complex inventory systems.

## Technologies Used
